# simple-Java-GUI

This is a Java class file for a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using the NetBeans IDE. It contains a frame with a label and four buttons, each representing a different menu option: "Ventas," "Promociones," "Nómina," and "Salir."

The code includes event listeners for each button that open a new window when clicked. The "Ventas" button opens a window for tracking sales, "Promociones" button opens a window for managing promotions, and "Nómina" button opens a window for managing employee payroll. The "Salir" button closes the application.

The GUI uses basic Swing components, such as JLabels, JButtons, and JFrames. The code generated by NetBeans is enclosed in a private method called initComponents(), which is called by the public constructor Menu() to create the interface. The class has default access modifiers and belongs to a package called pizzeria.
